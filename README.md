# Text Classifier: AI vs SLW (Second Language Writers)

[Streamlit](https://text-classifier-cgjwcf54nng8fax4cuszie.streamlit.app/)

This Streamlit-based web app classifies whether a given text sample is written by a Second Language Writer (SLW) or generated by AI. It uses syntactic complexity indices and provides SHAP contribution plots for transparent model explanation.

This project was built as a personal learning project to explore linguistic data science, and syntactic complexity modeling.

## Features

- Load real-world `.txt` samples by index
- Visualize Syntactic Complexity Indices (e.g., MLS, CN_C, VP_T)
- Generate classification results with confidence scores
- Explore SHAP waterfall plots to interpret predictions

## About the syntactic Complexity Indices

The classifier uses L2SCA Indices by TAASSC

Predictions are supported by SHAP contribution plots, showing how each feature influences the outcome toward AI or SLW.
